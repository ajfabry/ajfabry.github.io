## Hey there Emma.

So I've been sitting down for a while, and I've got a little bit of wisdom to share as you go through the next few years of school.

Right now, in the middle of your freshman year, things are probably pretty easy for you. You might say it's been like a walk in the park:

<video controls style="
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 40%;">
  <source src="/assets/emma/hike.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video>

<br>
And since you've got your awesome meal plan on campus, you may even feel like you've been eating like a pig:

  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 40%;" />

<br>
But, believe me when I tell you that things will become more challenging. Don't be scared, though!

  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 40%;" />

<br>
Once you get the hang of things, you'll feel like you're wearing many different hats.

  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 40%;" />

<br>
Still, you may face some challenges that seem to be insurmountable:

<div class="text-row">
  <div class="text-column">
    <img src="/assets/emma/power1.png" style="width: 100%;" />
  </div>
  <div class="text-column">
    <img src="/assets/emma/power2.png" style="width: 100%;" />
  </div>
</div>

<br>
As long as you maintain your determination, though, you can accomplish anything. It also helps to have a family that supports you.

  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 40%;" />

<br>
Just be careful not to fall too hard on your face.

<video controls style="
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 40%;">
